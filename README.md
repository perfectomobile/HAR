# Perfecto's DevWeek HARckathon

Welcome to today's challenge! Are you ready to win $2,000? Awesome. Let's begin.

## Today's challenge

Your challenge today is to build a reusable, standalone tool that accepts one or more HAR files and provides
 an analysis on inefficiencies, performance issues, non-relevant data, potential security risks, and analysis
 other insights you think will be helpful to others.

You can write in any language, framework, or platform you chose provided that the tools you used
 are either open source or free. That way others can benefit from your work too.

## What is HAR?

The HTTP Archive (HAR) format is a JSON document containing a set of network requests.

For mobile apps, network efficiency is critical for stable, fast user experiences. Large transactions,
 location and analytics data, and other 3rd party API calls can quickly make the app suck.


## Getting Started

There are already lots of tools around the HAR format.

The first thing you'll probably need is a HAR parser
 in your preferred programming language. For instance:
- [Java](https://github.com/sdstoehr/har-reader)
- [Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/haralyzer/1.4.10)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/jarib/har)
- [.NET](https://github.com/giacomelli/HarSharp)

## A few ideas

A few ideas for example:

- [yslow.org best practices and rules](http://yslow.org/)
- [OWASP REST Security cheat sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet)
